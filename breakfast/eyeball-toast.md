# Eyeball Toast 
### (my kids' favorite, alternatively known as *Birds in a Nest*)

## Dave Shuck

### Ingredients
* 1 slice whole wheat bread
* one large egg
* 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil

### Preparation
* Heat a pan on a medium-low setting
* While pan is heating, use a small cup with 2-2.5" diameter cup to cut a whole out of the center of the bread
* When pan is hot, carefully pour olive oil into the pan
* Place both pieces of bread into the pan on the olive oil
* Crack egg and carefully empty the contents into the whole of the bread without breaking the yoke
* Take a moment to reflect on the eyeball staring back at you.
* After 3 minutes as the bread begins to brown on the bottom and the egg solidifies, flip the pieces of bread
* After 2 more minutes, remove everything from the pan and serve.
